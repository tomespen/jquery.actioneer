# jquery.actioneer
Simple action launcer made for Efi's customerservice intranet.
The launcher was inspired by [Launcy](http://www.launchy.net/) and [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) and bears resemblance to these applications.

Big thank you to [Efi](http://www.efi.no) which allowed me to Open Source the code, which was developed on their time.

Homepage and live example soon...
